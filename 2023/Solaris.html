            This had a lot more philosophical thinking than action points than I was expecting. The book raised good points about what humans end goals are when it comes space exploration. There was some points where it was as if he had copy and pasted a doctorate thesis paper in the book, which I did not understand. It reminded me of the picture of Dorian Gray's long chapter. I feel as if the author spent so long explaining the science side that he often forgot about the plot. I found some of the dialogue tempo to be strange but that have been becasue of cultural translation or the period it was written in.
