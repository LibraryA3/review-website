            As the author describes in the acknowledgements, people often often say the sequel in a trilogy is often the hardest to get through. But I wouldn't say that that's the case of this book. It felt like the author had perfectly constructed the maturing of the characters from the first to the end of the second book. When I began to question what was happening with the plot towards the end, I was reeled perfectly back in by the revealing explanations and conclusions. I don't remember what details I was referring to in the previous review, but i was left with no questions of confusion after finsihing this book. All perfect conclusion for a sequel/book.
