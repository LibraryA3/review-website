            I picked up a book set before the 80s and I always think maybe I'll like this one. The truth is I can't get over the world's horrible past and I wish authors would rewrite history ethics when writing during the past. I enjoyed the ending as it wasn't happy but it was final and I enjoy finality. I wouldn't call the story a tragedy more like a story of mispalced pride and ego. I thinkt he mroal of the story is that people's lives are worth more than what those people think of you. I enjoyed the gasp worthy moment pf foreshadowing from Briseis, that was well placed. I agree with C.E.S, beautiful in way that was tragic.
