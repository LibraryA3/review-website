            This was an enjoyable read. I will be honest and say I only liked reading about Niclays Roos towards the end, however I am unsure if I can see what the actual character did for the plot. Additionaly, his sudden change of heart towards Sbran and Ead confused me as if the author had left out a line of thought. The more positive points. I found it intriguing how the author pulled the four seperate viewpoints towards each other. The battle with the NAmeless One was, I believe, well written and quick cuts within an action film sequence. Overall, a joy to read and would recommend to anyone who has the time.
