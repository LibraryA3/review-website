            Overall, I was not particularly enthralled with the book, but it was easy to read. At some points my own ehart was racing out of sympathetic fear for the girls and Lei having to face to Bull King. Aoki was a good portrayal of an example of Stockholm syndrome, feeling the horror with Lei when Aoki began to dend and sympathis with the Bull King. I did however feel that her eyes were made to be big point of the book but almost as if there was a mystery behind them that the author forgot to include. Although, this may be included in the sequel. The fate pendant also felt anti-climatic.
