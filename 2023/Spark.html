            This book's ending did genuinely leave me needing to pick up the third book immediately but unfortunately, i don't have it. All around a good book and there are points where you think the author has forgotten a plot point, but it then gets strategically revealed for the best effect. If you think a little deeper about the plot of the book, it raises some interesting points about propaganda and that history will always be misconstrued due to higher powers and different point of views. I think that there were some points the author decided they wanted soemthing different for a character, so there were a few abrupt personality changes. But all in all, a good sequel and can't wait to read the third.
