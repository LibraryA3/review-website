            I enjoyed how Greene structured this book. She would start by introducing a topic that almost seemed random, analysed her thoughts, then meshed her poetic and philosophical knowledge in, to then link that all back to a concept of space. The book included some truly interesting facts and case studies that were explained with such reverance, that I went away to conduct my own research on the matter. Thinking back, I thought that she mentioned her ex-wife quite frequently, but I suppose she's still grieving the loss of that relationship and what it used to contribute to her life.
