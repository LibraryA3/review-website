            I enjoyed this book despite my annoyance at the mildly over repeated phrase of "sky-falling". I think the phrase may be linked to the "pray for rain" line but Balladarians used it as well, so i wasn't quite sire what it emant. Perhaps it was a replacement of "for god's sake". Anyways, the book has a very clear, quick moving narrative as well as good setting descriptors. I found it hard to attach to Luca as it seemed she couldn't learn from her mistakes. This could be said for Touraince, however her mistakes had motive due to her emotionally clinigng to her past for approval. Some aspects of details are unclear; however I am unsure if this is purposeful or not.
