            This book was absolute chaos and i loved it. There was an obvious Plot A and B, but then, due to the chaotic nature, there are other small subplots to follow. Such as the continued question of who wrote Shakespeare's plays. The lack of explanation of the world setting was the basis for at least half of the chaos as you often found yourself reading dialogue that sounds absolutely barmy without context. Additionally, if this were ever turned into a film or a series, I feel like Jim Carrey, or someone with equal the amount of facial expressions, should play Acheron Hades, because that man needs to be portrayed by someone positively insane.
