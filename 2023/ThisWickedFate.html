            I enjoyed this as an "easy read" that is to say the language wasn't too hard to think on while the plot still held me captive. It was nice to see that the main protagonist was actually effected by the events that happened around her rather than what a lot of YA authors do where they focus on the characters confidence and demeanour to the world rather than their inner processing of the vents. I understand how this book would be important for the POC community as I have found comfort in the Queer representation. It gave good descriptions of grief that were not someone just crying the enitre time or being very aggressive. Overall, a very good book and series, I'm excited to read mroe from the author.
