            A lot of books i have read previously have had colsure; however, this book and Solaris have both been open ended. I found that I enjoyed the openess of this book more than the previous becasue I was left thinking about it afterwards.Solaris had a more settled ending and therefore I didn't think about it as much. I enjoyed the untrustworthy narrator when describing the horrific aspects. I read the authors interview where she said this was to purposefully show how little Miri was processing what was happening. The observations that Miri recounts after the trip and the way the author connected those to Leah's point of view was genius, and I enjoyed noticing the connections a lot. 10/10 would recommend.
