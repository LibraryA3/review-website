            Throughout the majority of this book, I felt as if I was reading the daily recounts of someone's diary(which I suppose it was). The structure of the timeline often confused me and some aspects of the story I am still unsure about. A friend told me to then read the historical notes and I whole-heartedly agree. While reading the notes my understanding of the structure increases and I was less aggravated at the book. However, the absent use of speech marks left me GCSE English language brain confused. It also didn't leave in thought just confusion and not the good kind.
