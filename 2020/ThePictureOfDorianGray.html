            I struggled to finish the book as I personally find books easier to read when there is more conversation text than was present in here. Chapter 11 was completely unnecessary and only included a few references to the present storyline. Although I suppose that could allude to the idea of Dorian Gray slowly going insane. Once you get past the middle section of the book, I found that there was a better flow of plot and was easier to engage with the story. The ending baffled me as it managed to not be surprising and surprising all at once. The book alluded to what was going to happen, but I believe it was the way Wilde chose to frame the ending that gave it the element of surprise. While answering many questions, the book manages to leave the reader with multitudes more questions and a lingering thought in the mind for days.
