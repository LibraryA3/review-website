            The book was as you would expect from any Roald Dahl book. It had made up words and someone who never seemed of right mind. The second storyline came around in a very random manner it reminded me of my train of thought. Where you are talking about one thing and end up on a completely different subject. The negative points that I have are that the storyline was a strange structure, racist stereotypes apparently? The old people also aggravated me as they never believed any problem was their fault.
