            The storyline was constantly moving but there was also relaxed moments where you could enjoy witty humour. It was nice to have a female criminal for a change and a female main character of a Sci-Fi book, I also like how romance was not a plot B, it was more 'a few mentions that is then referenced at the end to bring the book to a close', I also like the diverse range of ethnicities such as the main character (Jazz) was of Arabic descent. I hope that there will be a sequel in the future.
