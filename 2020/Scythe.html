            Throughout the book the reader is constantly encouraged to refletct on their views and feelings towards death. While the author often expresses the Devil's Advocate view the reader questions themselves as to whether they agree or not. There were many thought provoking moments but the book still managed to keep some comedic elements to it. Such as the lovely quote of "I want you to push me in front of a truck". All in all a fantastic concept for a story and i look forward to reading more.
