            This book took me a very long time to finish. I kept reading a few pages, putting it down, then picking it up again. Last night I decided I was finally going to finish it and it was the best choice I made. From the start of reading and to the end, the book was filled with excitement and enticement. The represented communities however were depicted in bad tastes. The storyline had a very different output than what I had originally thought when starting the series. I could not put it down till the very end. This book had a  very surprising yet soothing ending where it did not feel unfinished which is hard to achieve.
