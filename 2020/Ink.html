            This book took me by surprise in the end. As I began reading, I thought the main character was immature and the beliefs of the world were pure rubbish as I couldn't believe anyone would believe the tales- though upon reflection many belief in the miracles performed by Jesus so who am I to judge. Towards the end there was real character growth and the characters emotions and feelings felt more valid than they had been before. My only problems were that it was not until the very end that I was invested as the plot was a slow burner. While reading I was preparing to not want to the sequel. Fortunately, now having finished the book, I would like to purchase the sequel (Future me does indeed have the sequel).
