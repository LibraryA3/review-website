            The sequel was better than the first book, only by 1 mark still better. The pointless romance was mentioned less; however, another was added for a third character that was also pointless. The ending was unexpected. I desperately need to read the third book as the sequel leaves the reader on a cliffhanger that I have thought about almost every day after. The book is very fast paced. A few that made me physically gasp and stop to think.
