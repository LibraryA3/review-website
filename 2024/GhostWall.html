            This kind of book has the same review as Circe. Good book, just maybe not my type. It was interesting however and when someone asked me what it is like while reading it, i would say it was... weird. I can't tell if I find the ending anticlimatic or if the author just did a good job at freaking the reader out. I have to say that the book does make you realsie how there are so many or have been so many cults in the world. Humans naturally have a sense of belonging and pair that with the emotioins music can make us feel creates a dangerous mix. Even the main character herself was almost drawn into the insanity until she was targeted.
