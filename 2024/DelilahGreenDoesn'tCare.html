            Turn's out, I do like Rom-Com's, they just have to be gay. It was so refreshing to see sapphic love with a happy and compelte ending. No homophobia storyline in sight. I think my favourite trope or event within the romance is the idea that falling in love with someone is the when you know what it's like to be seen. They might not know or understand everything about you, but they want to know, and they ask to understand the best that they can. It also shows that you can have been bestfriends forever but never have the most important conversations. After reading the sneak peak of the sequel, I immediately wan tot pick it up to learn more about these amazing characters.
