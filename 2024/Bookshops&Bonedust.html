            Once again, this author has created a cosy yet eventful book. With all the smart quips you would expect from your favourite sit-com to the recollective moments you see in classic literature. In addition to the book, the illustrations for the book and chapter characters are an amazing addition to delve into the picturesque coziness that is the sea-side town on Murk. Anyone looking for an easy read should pick up this book and settle down with a nice cup of coffee. You become attached to all the characters, almost miss them as if you were Viv leaving to be with the Ravens again. Also, my goes out to Maylee, for having the wrong ends of the hill.
