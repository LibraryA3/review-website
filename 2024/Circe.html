            I'll be honest. It was good book, just not my cup of tea. The plot had movement with Circe understanding her worth, deciding with imortality, and correcting her mistakes. I believe I falsely remembered someone saying this was sapphic, si I did spend the entire book anticipating something that wasn't there. It's always good to read different types of books becasue you can learn more about what you genuinely want to read while still enjoying a good storyline. The Greek Mythology information was very interesting, and it would be interesting to see which points were artistic liberty and what has been recorded Greek Myths.
