            Warning that this book is definitely 18+. Not the whole book, but the moments that are sexual, are SEXUAL if you get me. For only being 411 pages, I feel like i've managed to read a whole trilogy. I wasn't absolutely enraptured bby it, but i still think it was a great book. I especially loved how Ma bought the less erious side out of Zhu. I was expecting there to be a big reveal that Zhu was a woman as it was a similar plot to Mulan, but thinking on it the plot choice to not reveal made sense, because she never revealed herself as it wouldn't have had a happy ending for all the greatness she had achieved. My only dislike is the multiple POV's, but that is a personal preferance.
