            Amazing Fabulous Fantastic, whatever the rest of that Lady Gaga quote is, this book had it. I maybe wouldn’t recommend it for people who don’t have a scientific background or interest as the book gets very math and engineering heavy in some places. I actually watched the film before reading it and surprisingly there are quite a few differences between the two once you get halfway. The personality of Mark Watney shone through this books creating such an entertaining read. Adding the eery flashbacks to the canvas making was a good touch to really get the readers heartbeat racing. Total structure and plot of the book was great, I have no bad notes.
