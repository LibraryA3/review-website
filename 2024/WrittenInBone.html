            *CHECK TW WARNINGS BEFORE READING THIS BOOK* <br> <br>
            I found this book very interesting and well written. Some parts are not for the faint hearted where the author goes into exact anatomical detail of damage inflicted to a victom. However, the author is an anatomist, so that was kind of a prerequisite. It left me thinking (as encouraged by the author) what would my bones and body tell of my life to someone. Probably a broken knuckle and maybe a few diet changes found in my nails, but I don't think there would be anything else out of the normal. The author uses all the scientific phrases while making sure the reader doesn;t get too lost in the technical jargon. Would recommend to fellow "how does the body work?" enthusiasts.
