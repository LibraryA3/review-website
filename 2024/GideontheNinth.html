            I'll be honest and say that half the time I had no clue what was going on but the Author wrote in such a gripping way that I didn't really need to. To some readers, the lack of setting or background information at the start may lose their interest. I did find myself flicking to the start as I often forgot who was a member of what house. The cliffhangers however, were masterfu. I gasped at least three times in the last 300 pages. I would have preferred a different ending however I can understand why the Author made the plot choice that she did. It's kind of like if your team wins the match, but you didn't get to score any goals. Anyways, glad I have the sequal already so that I can continue thos storyline further.
