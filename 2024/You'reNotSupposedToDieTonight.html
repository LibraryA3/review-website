            As much as I enjoy this Authors previous books, I have mixed feelings about this one. For a first horror book written by the author I would say it was pretty good. I genuinely couldn't read the first half of the book at night for fear of nightmares. However, the second half is where I have my mixed reviews. The plot of the cult seemingly came out of nowhere as if the author hadn't quite decided on the plot yet. You're almsot led to believe it would be more of a supernatiral element to it and less of a mystical carnivorous ground. It also felt as if Bayron couldn't decide who she wanted to be final girl so allowed for Charity to come back in the end snippet. Overall, a good read but not the best plot wise.
