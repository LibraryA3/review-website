            Reading this book felt like a fever dream. I genuinely think this man must be on some form of psychedelic to write these books. The structure of the whole book throws you for a loop; for starters there are no chapters, only starred intervals. But I think that if the book had really been written with seperate chapters, it would have entirely ruined the run-on sentence fever dream feeling you get when you read it. I honestly think that if i described to this to book to someone and gave them some of the quotes, they would think i was on crack. This book has the type of humoure that makes you stop mid-sentence, shake your head, then chuckle to yourself. It's honestly such a great book that reminds you that sometimes you can read books about ominous luggage with legs.
