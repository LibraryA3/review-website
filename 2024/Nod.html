            When I finsihed this book, I let out a large sigh of air and said "...Jesus". If someone asked I would recommend this book, I wouldn't be able to give them an answer. It was entirely morbid, rather depressing, in some places disgusting, and occassionally thought-stopping. it stopped my thoughts in the way that my only thought was "what the f*ck". It is, however, an entirely different take on the end-of-world apocolypse genre. It does bring to mind that Russian experiment myth that always had a really creepy thumbnail. The basis was that depriving a group of people of sleep and locking them away, led to horrific psychotic breakdowns and horror-like creepiness. All in all, would not read again, glad I read it, but I will be disturbed for a few months by it.
