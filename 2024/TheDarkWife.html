            I really enjoyed this book, probably because it was really gay but *trigger warning* it does mention rape. The description of how Zeus lied to mortals had me thinling how many stories have we been told that were lies just because a man wanted to be seen as the most powerful. I would love to see more retellings of Greek Mythology where the female characters are given justice and not seen to be petty but powerful and vengeful. This was a good easy read to take a break from heavy lore and plot-based books. The idea of Hades and Persephone being sapphic lvoers gives me an idea for a tattoo...
