            Amazing light-hearted story about a fighter who looks for a change of pace from her regular life of brutality. It's almost the opposing plot of "the chosen one" storyline. The person has gotten over the hype and glory of battle and wants a calm life where they don't have to worry abou the next time that they will be bleeding or potentially dying. An easy read and great for anybody that has finished reading a fast-pasced high fantsy and wants a relief or a break. It may be based on a Dungeons & Dragons fantasy world, but previous knowledge of the world is definietely not needed to enjoy this sotry.
