            I was confused throughout the whole book when it came to how Klara saw the world. The ‘lifted’ aspect was never fully explained and it felt like an unnecessary part in the book used solely for the readers engagement to continue. I’m never personally a fan of a writer not explaining the setting of the current events as I find it adds unnecessary confusion. Josie's father made a good point about how robots could never replicate dead people as they would never be able to capture the true essence of a person's soul.
