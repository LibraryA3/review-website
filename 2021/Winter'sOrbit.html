            I appreciated how this book represented the mindset of a domestic abuse victim and how it changed their views on themselves. I also loved how Kiem had a healthy response to Jaina's troubles and helped him heal and be more confident. I loved the inclusion of a non-binary character and how each plant represented their gender. Also loved the inclusion of consent. There was never a dull moment and read the book in my mind as if I was watching a TV show.
