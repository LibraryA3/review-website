            The language was surprisingly easier to understand than Wuthering Heights which was written close to it. There was not many climatic moments only a sudden ending that felt given up on. As if the writer just felt wanted to finish the book. It wasn't bad however it felt drawn out, as if it was not really going anywhere. It kind of has the same narrative style as The Current war film. The description of the other worldly was good for the time that it was written and didn't fee; complicated or over detailed.
