            This book was slow moving and had a constant theme of men demeaning women throughout. There were parts where I was frustrated due to the clear writing of the male gaze. I found the storyline between the main woman and man character cute and the fast forward of them enjoying life was nice. The ending was unsatisfying as the writer consistently repeated information without need and when it was from another point of view no new information was added and was therefore dull. The puzzle scene at the end was infuriating as the answer was so clear.
