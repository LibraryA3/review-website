            Read this book all in one day which can be attributed to its easy poetic language and my inability to stop engaging with the book. The slow realisation of Tamsin's feelings throughout kept me hooked like bait in a pond full of gay fish. The multiple metaphors used to describe nature were beautiful and the slow emotional healing of both characters was great too. The twist could have been guessed but the author left multiple possibilities for the reader to ponder on and be lead astray. The casual inclusion of the LGBTQ+ community was well incorporated.
