            This book gave a whole new story to one of your classic fairy tales. The way the romance was portrayed, and the story was so easy to follow was great. In the beginning I wished for Erin and Sophia's to stay together but after Sophia's visit to her I realised that Constance was healthier and better for her. I lover how excepting the parents were. My only fault was that I felt Constance and Sophia's relationship was slightly underdeveloped.
