            It has taken me four months to read this book and it was not worth it. I found all of the characters to be unlikeable, the ending to be anti-climatic and the whole plot was basically one big gossip fest. There were a few phrases that had beautiful wording and were thought provoking which gave some reason to want to read this book. It is one of those books that is nice to have an opinion on and to say you have read it but you absolutely hated reading it. Reading the dialogue of the character Joseph to my mum was entertaining.
