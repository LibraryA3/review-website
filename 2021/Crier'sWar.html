            I thought this book would be a hard read however it appeared to a matter of mindset as I read it in a day. The design of the book is wonderful, with or without the dustcover. There were no sudden shocks of major betrayal but there were small moments that led to a big discovery. I was engaged and attached to the characters and immediately bought the sequel. I felt that the plot had a very steady increase in events and there was never a dull moment. If you are to read this don't let the understanding of the history and name pronunciations of the fantasy world let you down.
