            The different perspective that this book gives on the bible is amazing. It makes you think religion or Christianity over even if you are atheist. This book had the pace similar to that of Perks of being a Wallflower. The references to small details from the beginning at the end encourages the reader to feel as if they had been on an emotional journey with Hannah and Baker, where these details were represented with juxtaposing atmospheres, yearning opposed to fulfilment and content.
