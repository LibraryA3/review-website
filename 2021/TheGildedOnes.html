            The plot of this book was amazing. I am always a fan of a lead female character having an unknown power inside of her. The twists and turns were written well. I was enthralled with the mystery of the Gilded Ones and was enticed for Deka to find out the mysteries of her life story. I also liked how the LGBTQIA+ characters were casually represented. However, I have yet to read a fantasy book where there is not compulsory romance. On the other hand, the romance was not the driving force of Deka's power which I appreciated.
