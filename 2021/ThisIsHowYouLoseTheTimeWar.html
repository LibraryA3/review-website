            I was confused until two-thirds of the way in when less context of the world setting was needed to enjoy the plot. As stated before, I'm not a fan of books that give no explanation to the world setting as I find I can't engage with the storyline as well as other books. I did, however, highlight multiple quotes as the language was so heartbreakingly romantic. The recurring theme of hunger could be felt by the reader as they strived for the romance to win above all else.
