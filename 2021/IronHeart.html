            I read this in a whole night and boy was it worth it. The character development between the characters was great as I felt that the characters matured very well with the situations. There was a wide representation of genders throughout the book that I enjoyed. The shocks were not overwhelming yet still gasp worthy. I once again felt attached and connected to the characters through Varela's amazing way of presenting emotions such as fear and anger. Thinking about messages within the book, one stands out to me. Even the most perfect creature cries. I feel that is a wonderful message to young readers.
