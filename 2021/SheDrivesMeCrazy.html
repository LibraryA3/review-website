            During the beginning I thought Scottie acted in a toxic way and even though her healing process was well written I feel as if there should have been more self-reflection on the way Scottie spoke to Irene. However, I'm glad this book was written as it felt like I was watching a cheesy indie romance film, but it had representation that I wanted. I adored the ending and caught myself smiling hard multiple times. It's worth better reviews than what I have seen on Twitter.
