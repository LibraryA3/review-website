            I started this book believing it was a Sci-Fi book and realised it was in fact a thriller. Having never read a Thriller before I was apprehensive about how much I would like the nature of the book, but I was delightedly surprised to find I enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I did not feel as invested and attached to the characters as I had in previous books I have read. Sometimes I believed that detail could be removed in one place and put into another however, that is a matter of opinion and should not dissuade other from reading it. The ending, I felt, was unfinished, as if it was written in a rush and the author did not have enough time to think it through.
