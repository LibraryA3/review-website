            I loved this book every step of the way. The language encouraged the reader to feel as if they were Monique interviewing Evelyn by allowing them to clearly understand the interactions that were unfolding between Evelyn and Monique. I do feel as if Evelyn was slightly manipulative but then following the thought process, I then could understand why she felt complelled to act that way. The theme of the book was to not regret your decisions and to be confident about making the best life for you. The book represented that being good doesn't mean being human.
