            Due to the nicknames for each character, it was hard to keep track of who was who, but it became more established. The imagery of the town was well written however the glossary should have been easier to find. Two-thirds within the book I was reading a scene that I felt could have happened earlier if the writer had not drawn the book out so long. The ending, however, was satisfactory and was nice to see Konstantin face the Karma of his actions. Elaboration on the magic would have been well received.
