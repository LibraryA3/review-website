            Amazing. I absolutely loved the endinig and how it rounded off the whole idea of the dystopia societies and what caused them. I thought it was a very clever way of personifying a concept into a character. The author picks the right sentence structures and plot tempo to always have you engaged. All around, great easy series to read.
