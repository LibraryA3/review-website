            The only reason this book didn't score 100% amazing in my book was that it left me wanting more at the end even though it's a stand alone. I love how you could arrive at your own theories throughout the book as you read the books mentioned along with Zachary. I loved the split narratives as it kept me emerced and never bored. The quick, witty one liners that also gave way to one-line twists. I love the descriptive writing style. I loved how twice the idea of the end being the beginning was mentioned, and how the book structure followed that same narrative. Also, GAY we love. I love Zachary getting full named all the time.
