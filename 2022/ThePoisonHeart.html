            Thinking back on the book, I could find no faults within that made me annoyed or mad. I realise now that this author ensures not to make romance the characters personality and the way the relationship is being built up is clever and portrays healthy romantic development. The plot of the story moved at a good pace. The building to crescendo's was cleverly built and the betrayal of one character and the next were made through clever misleads. The emotions portrayed by all characters were realistic and healthy. The cover art illustration is also amazing, I like it better than the one for Cinderella as there are more details.
