            At some points in the book I wanted to scream at the main character when she did something I disagreed with. It was less of a disagreement and more of a 'I've figured it out before you and its painful when you haven't yet'. Altogether, the starting 2/3's of the book were hard to get through, however I believe that is the nature of most sequels within a trilogy as they are the go between the large events of the book. The author does a great job at keeping the momentum at the end to ensure the interest of the readers for the final book.
