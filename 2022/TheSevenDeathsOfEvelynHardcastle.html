            This book had many twists and turns that were unexpected. The fantasy twists on an otherwise regular crime is what made the book engaging. I had a few hang-ups on a few writing choices. I felt as if the word 'queer' was used so much as if the author was excited to be able to use it and not get in trouble. I understood that it was used as synonym for odd in that period, but it felt overused. Some aspects of the book felt like the author had changed their mind on what the main character knew and felt. When it came to the big moments it felt like something had been skipped. The whole plot was still engaging despite its faults.
