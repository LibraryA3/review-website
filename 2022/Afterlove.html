            I enjoyed the overall messages that the author had about death. How the idea of what you think will happen at the end is constantly changing. I was critically annoyed at the ending but then realised it reflected how no one ever knows what happens when you are truly dead. My two kickbacks were that I thought that author got carried away with the analogies and metaphors. The other was that there was little explanation of the mystical side fo the story, however I suppose that would make the stand-alone book too long. Quick enjoyable read.
