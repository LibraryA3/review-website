            I enjoyed this book a lot. It left me appreciative how far we've come as a society for people to be themselves and left me sorrowful for those who are still pnusihed for who they love and how they express themselves. The snippets into the past were insightful and helpful to build an understanding of the history behind the setting. I felt so proud of Lily when she refused to deny who she was no matter how easy it would have made her future. Even when she was forced one way, she found a way, she found a way to persevere, much like what the fortune cookie message she threw to the wind had told her to do. A great book to read to grasp the LGBTQIA+ culture for other ethnicities in the 50s.
