            This book honestly took a turn that had me scared and worried and I absolutely loved it, "Don't judge a book by its cover" see I did and it's not that I thought it would be a bad book, the book just ended up having a completely different vibe than I had anticipated. I was 100% a fan of the short chapter structure as it allowed me to feel like I was procesing quicker through the book and none of the details or writing felt forced because each chapter only began when Frances had soemthing to say and ended exactly when she had nothing to say. I would recommend as a great book and structure for people who are just getting into reading.
