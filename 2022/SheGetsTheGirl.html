            I adored this book, and it struggled through a few different issues. There wwere so many "oh <i>oh</i>" moments that had me smiling and kicking my feet. I also teared up twice at the end and getting me to tear up twice at the end and getting me to tear up even once is a score so this did well in terms of emotional dialogue. The book was well paced as well and, unlike a lot of sapphic media, felt developed and understandable. The beginning of the book had me mildly disliking Alex, but that may be because I'm like Molly and don't realise how someone can so effortlessley flirt without having to overthink it over in a million different wayds. I also loved the depction of liking the idea of being in love and actually being in love.
