            This felt like a completely different book to the one I read in Year 8. I enjoyed the three perspectives and how you almost felt sorry for the monster until the different point of views and you were once again reminded of his faults. I liked the depictions of the men actually feeling emotions. This may have been becasue of the female author. I did almost gasp at the reveal before the wedding, the telling of narrative built enigma very well. I love how much Frankenstein cherished his friend Henry Cleval. It did take me a while to read so I only remember the beginning broadly.
