            This book went nowhere and everywhere all at once. It passed throuhg multiple years of history without explaining it had done so, where it then took me two pages to realise significant time had passed. It was very clear by the way the author wrote his main figures that if he were a villain he would practice his evil, maniacal monologue in the mirror for several hours straight. This book also made me realise I should stop reading books written before the 70's as I never enjoy them unless they're The Picture of Dorian Gray or Frankenstein. I enjoyed the plot twists' but there were so many that were similar to each other that you could see it coming.
