            The third book was not what I had expected. However, it still lived up to the expectations that I held for it. The way the author designs three different worlds yet manages to conenct them through similar narratives is amazing. i was once again engaged by the simplistic yet detailed writing. i am looking forward to the final book where I will take a guess that the worlds converge to reveal one big mystery.
