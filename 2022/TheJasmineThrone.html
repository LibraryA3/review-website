            The cultural representation within this book was amazing. I was a fan of the different take on the inclusion of romance. Instead of love interests believing their partner was perfect, they accepted and admired their differences. The characters were not encapsulated by their love, they understood that they had duties that came before themselves. The imagery was laso so detailed that I could picture Ahiranya with such clarity, it was beautiful. The only criticism that I have was the abruptness of the ending. I understand that there is a sequel, however, I felt it was anti-climatic and could have had more suspense.
