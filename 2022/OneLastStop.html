            So many twists and turn in this book I absolutely loved it. Although, once again I so say I am biased towards any form of queer media and will blindly say its good. I'd like to dsay most of the time I'm right though as sapphic love is beautiful which was portrayed so well within this book. The LGBTQIA+ scene within New York was written so well that I almost felt like I was there myself and wanted to be there as well. The structure was well made so that when dealing with a bombarding amount of information it was less textbook paragraph and more "listening to a friend tell a heart felt song" and had the same warm comforting vibe as "that old man who narrates the start of a kids film like The Grinch".
