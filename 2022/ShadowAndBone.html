            I love how this author writes action. It's quick and snappy to match the current action within the story, but it still allow for details to support imagery for the reader. I immediately had to pick up the sequel when I got to the end as the cliff-hanger left me in so much suspence. The descriptions of 'The Fold' were some of my favourite parts of the book. It was an overall good first book to start off a trilogy.
