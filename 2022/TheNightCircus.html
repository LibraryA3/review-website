            Once again, the writing of this author amazes me. Even in the slow moments of the narrative, I was never bored. Morgenstern is able to be dramatic yet in a simple way as to not over complicate the description. In regards to the book itself, the narrative was once again written in an unstructured way that allowed a period of rest for the reader as to not overwhelm them with the story. Even though there poignant main characters you felt connected to very single one of them through their description. I preferred this endiing as it left me with a sense of calm and understanding, rather than an inquisitive mind guessing how the story leads on.
