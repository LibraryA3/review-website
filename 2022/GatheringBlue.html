            My first comment is that I really love the cover art and design for this book. My next is that I am now understanding that the first three books in the series are introductions to the people who will probably be the main characters in the fourht book 'SON'. I like how the book has similar narrative pace and structure to the first book, however it still manages to engage the audience. I am looking forward to reading the next book.
